# This is a replica of apple's Macbook Pro configuration page using bootstrap.


## Example Page

![apple's own site](https://res.cloudinary.com/zzrot/image/upload/v1539706519/macbook%20pro%20configurator/mockup_example.png)


## Project Notes
* This page is **not** responsive (yet).

## Challenges in this project
* How to use custom fonts in your webpage.
* How to use jQuery/javascript to manipulate the DOM.
* 



## Features can be added later

* Make it responsive? (Apple's site is not)
* Add in the full page image gallery linked to the Macbook Pro image
* Cards section do not look exactly like the apple page. They divided those cards into many sub-divs and then positioned the texts in it.
* Expand the navbar bottom border to full width?

### NOTES!!!

>  Will come back to finish this project after I finish all the challenges on freeCodeCamp's javascript data structures and algorithms section.
